## Introduction

Welcome to the **Face Mood Analyzer**! This project harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to analyze emotions from facial expressions in photos. It can detect faces, assess emotions, and even generate music that matches the mood detected. Built using Python, Flask, and advanced deep learning models like TensorFlow and PyTorch, this tool provides an interactive web interface for users.

The main goal of this repository is to provide a seamless experience in emotion detection and music generation based on facial expressions. Whether you're looking to enhance user experiences in applications or just want to explore the fascinating world of AI and emotion analysis, this project is for you.
